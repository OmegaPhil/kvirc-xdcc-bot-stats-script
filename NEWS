v0.2 (15.06.13):
Ability to remove registered XDCC bots via GUI.
Optional automatic authentication of DCC admin chats when the bot's password is configured.
DCC admin chat messages from registered bots can now be optionally 'quietened' so that no nick highlight, notification or flashing events are generated when messages are received.

v0.1 (25.05.13):
GetDynamicXDCCBotStats: Deal with 0 valid bots.
XDCCBotStatsScript: Allow user running this script to skip rank check for XDCC triggers in the channel (previously you needed to be hop+ if set in the channel).
Working status querying delays when bots arent on the server: Previously when a bot wasn't on the server, the code responsible for delaying the next request didnt work, so the non-existant bots would be permanently spammed every 30 seconds.

v0.01 (22.05.13):
Initial public release - Script is now capable of gathering stats from registered bots, processing and making available the data in normal channel and other triggers.
